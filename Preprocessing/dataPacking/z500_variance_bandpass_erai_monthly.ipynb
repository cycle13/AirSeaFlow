    "** Function     : Compute monthly mean variance of geopotential at 500hPa with a bandpass filter between 2-8 days(ERAI)** <br>\n",
    "** Author       : Yang Liu ** <br>\n",

    "Description  : This script serves to calculate the monthly mean variance of the geopotential at 500hPa based on subdaily data. A band-pass filter between 2-8 days are applied to make sure The variance of Z500 is a good indicator of the behavior of cyclones. This can provide extra information about the role of transient eddy when we investigate the meridional energy transport.<br>\n",
